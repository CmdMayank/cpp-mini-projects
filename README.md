# Student Report Card 📘

A simple C++ program that generates a student report card based on user input.  
This is my **first ever C++ project** 🚀.

## 📌 Features
- Input student name and roll number  
- Enter marks for 5 subjects  
- Calculates:
  - Total marks  
  - Average marks  
  - Grade (A, C, D, F)  

## 🛠 How It Works
1. The user enters student details and marks.  
2. The program calculates total and average marks.  
3. A grade is assigned based on the average score.  
4. The final report card is displayed neatly.  

## 🎯 Example Output

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Add support for more subjects
